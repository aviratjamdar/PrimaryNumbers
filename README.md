# PrimaryNumbers
PHP Coding Challenge - Altimetrik

Approach:

I have created this code with TDD approach. Intially I wrote the unit test cases with PHPUnit.
According to test cases success/failure code refactoring is done.

Below are the details on functionlity and test cases:

app\primeNumbers.php
	- Created a class called PrimeNumbers having functionlity to get and set the limit for prime numbers.
	- A function "findPrimeNumbers" is used to find n no of prime numbers starting from 2. It returns the array of n prime numbers.
	- A function "isNumberPrime" is used to actual check whether the given number is prime or not in optimized way.
		1. A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
		2. Every prime number can represented in form of 6n+1 or 6n-1 except 2 and 3, where n is natural number.
		3. If we want to check whether number n is prime or not, we can check till square root of n because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of smaller factor that has been already checked.
		4. Time complexity of this solution is O(âˆšn)
	- A function "getMultiplicationTable" is used to print the multiplication table as given in requirement.
	- Driver code is written to run the program 
		1. please provide the input like e.g. php app\primeNumbers.php 4 (Here 4 is the limit for prime numbers)
		
		
		
tests\unit\primeTest.php
	- Created 6 test cases and 11 assertions.
	- Test cases covered for checking command line input is write or not.
	- Prime number is funcitonality is appropriate or not.

If only test cases that need to be excecuted then please comment out the single line of code from file app\primeNumbers.php (LINE no 155)
